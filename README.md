This project is the idea I came to General Assembly with. It's not fully functional but once completed it will be a full CRUD cake inspiration application.

##User's Stories
-   When a user linked to the page they have the option to create and account, login, or go straight to the cake gallery.
-   If an account is created a "user's page" will show. Once signed in a user can add cakes to the gallery, logout, and delete their account.
Future features:
-   A user can create a cake design, edit the design, save it to their own gallery, and or send it to a bakery.
-   A user view their gallery, edit their gallery, delete design off their gallery

-   I spent a lot of time researching and developing a cake design canvas, which works perfectly outside of the app, but have not been able to include it currently.

##Issues & Bugs
-   Once cake is created unshift function breaks code so page needs to be refreshed to show new added cakes.
-   I set this app up with the intention of having the /cakes route only work as a show route and a separate route was created to store creations into a users gallery from the canvas. Unfortunately, since the canvas/creations route isn't set up I had to merge the added cakes to the /cakes route alone. This created a trickle down effect and hindered my other needed CRUD features.
